## don't forget to go to https://access.redhat.com/management/subscription_allocations 

# Step 1. go to https://access.redhat.com/management/subscription_allocations 
# to create a new Satellite 6.8 manifest. Add Ansible Automation Platform entitlements to it.
# download/export the new manifest, name it manifest.zip and place in the files/ directory

# Step 2. configure your workshop details
workshop:
  # this is used as a filter/prefix for your workshop
  name: demo-workshop
  # how many participants for the workshop
  how_many_students: 2
  # choose from rhel, security, windows, etc
  type: windows
  # you will need to own and manage this domain in aws router 53
  dns_zone: example.com
  # password used for all workshop logins
  default_password: ansible123
  # do you want to install tower on the system?
  towerinstall: yes

# you don't have to modify these
# used as convenience for aws section
rhel6_ami_id: ami-1643ff7e
centos7_ami_id: ami-0affd4508a5d2481b
rhel7_ami_id: ami-0315fe0b0bfdfedda
rhel8_ami_id: ami-058f90e71a7d69115

# Step 3. Configure your aws info
aws:
  # required
  # visit https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home?region=us-east-1#/security_credentials to create a pair
  keyid:
  secret:
  # modify the aws region as needed
  region: us-east-1
  # Optional: all below this line for aws, you may change as desired 
  # you can customize your remote user and key user, optional
  user: cloud-user
  # paste in your custom public key here to add to aws instance, or leave to None to use the aws key only
  user_pubkey: None
  # set a password that will need to be changed on first login, or leave to None for ssh key access only
  root_password: None
  # aws instance_type, no need to change
  instance_type: t3.medium
  # size of disk for workstation, change as needed or not
  volume_size: 150
  # leave at rhel8
  ami: "{{ rhel8_ami_id }}"

# Step 4. configure your redhat creds
redhat:
  # required
  # go to https://access.redhat.com/terms-based-registry/#/accounts to create a service account/password
  svcuser: "12345|your-name-here"
  svcpass: |
    abcd.paste.long.block.of.text.here.svcpass.xyz
  # go to https://access.redhat.com/management/api to create an offline token for redhat api access
  offline_token: |
    abcd.paste.long.block.of.text.here.token.xyz

# Step 5. encrypt these files with a password
# to protect your personal information
# ansible-vault encrypt group_vars/all
# ansible-vault encrypt files/manifest.zip

# Step 6. deploy the workshop workstation
# chmod +x ./deploy.sh
# ./deploy.sh

# variables for example awx/tower/aap job templates
# no need to modify
tower:
  server: localhost
  callback_key: none
  callback_jobid: 0
